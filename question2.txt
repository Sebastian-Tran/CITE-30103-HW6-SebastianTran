Some of this was also covered in Computer Systems Fundamentals, a class I am taking this semester as well, so some information
between classes might be mixed.

1.Editor
C Program starts as a source code when it is created in an editor, then by using a compiler (gcc).
	Errors: syntax errors.

2. Preprocessing 
When gcc compiles a .c file, the file is sent to the preprocessor (cpp) and a .i file is created when it processes the code.
	Errors: #include headers cannot be found.

3. Compilation
Afterwards, the .cpp file is sent to the compiler (cc1), which translates the code into assembly and a .s file.
	Errors: variable declaration errors, end statement errors (forgetting semicolon).

4. Assembly
The assembly code is sent into the Assembler (AS), which converts the assembly instructions into object code and creates .o file.
	Errors: function utilized that was not defined.

5. Linking/Loading
Lastly, the Linker/Loader (ld) combines the object file with the library files to create an output/executable file or .out file.
	Errors: Segmentation fault.
